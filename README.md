# ft_printf
My hive(42) ft_printf school project =D

You can find better solutions on github for sure, but this is mine, I hope you don't lose too many braincells reading it.

I have made two tester mains, one for the mandatory part and one for the bonus part for this project. You can find them in 'test' folder. 

If you're stuck, or otherwise interested, I hope this repo can help your journey in some ways atleast, even though it can be, at times, a bit hard to read.
